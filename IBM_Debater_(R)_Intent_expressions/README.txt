==========================================

The COVID-19 Vaccine Intent Expressions dataset containts 7,990 variying expressions for common questions about COVID-19 vaccines.

We collaborated with a team at Johns Hopkins University to curate a list 181 such common questions.

We then showed annotators a question from the list and asked them to express it in their words, imagining they are chatting with a knowledgable friend.

A subset of 324 expressions in this dataset are utterances taken from VIRADialogs, a dataset of conversations of users with a chatbot about COVID-19 vaccines.

The data is split to 3 files, train.csv and dev.csv and test.csv.

Each file contains the following columns:

1. sentence - the expression written by an annotator (or taken from VIRADialogs)
2. label - the question for which the expression was written
3. label_idx - the running class index associated with this label
